### Notes on ML Pipelines and ZenML

- **ML Pipeline**: An extension of building ML models that includes steps such as data acquisition, preprocessing, model deployment, and monitoring.
- **Benefits of Defining ML Pipelines in Code**:
  - **Reproducibility**: Enables rerunning all work, not just the model, which helps in debugging and makes models easier to reproduce.
  - **Versioning & Tracking**: Allows tracking of data and models, making it easy to identify the dataset a model was trained on and compare it with other models.
  - **Automation**: Enables automation of operational tasks such as retraining and redeployment of models when data or the problem changes. This also facilitates CI/CD workflows.
- **Importance**: Defining a clear ML pipeline is crucial for ML teams that want to scale model deployment and maintenance.

### ZenML Setup

- **ZenML**: A tool for defining ML pipelines, known for its straightforward and intuitive usage.
- **Integrations**: ZenML offers integrations with various advanced MLOps tools.
- **Installation**: Ensure ZenML is installed using the command `pip install zenml`.
- **Preparation**: Run commands to start with a fresh ML stack before defining pipelines.
